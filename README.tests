Tests for liblustre
===================

The tests expect that a Lustre filesystem be mounted. By default the
Lustre filesystem is mounted under '/mnt/lustre'. That setting can be
changed with -d option in the tests.

The tests are running under the 'check' test framework. See
http://check.sourceforge.net/ for its documentation.

Some tests may need some arguments.

To run the llapi_hsm_test, HSM must also be enabled on the MDT, and it
is recommended to set max_requests to a large value:

    lctl set_param mdt.lustre-MDT0000.hsm_control=enabled
    lctl set_param mdt.lustre-MDT0000.hsm.max_requests=1000

The lib_test and llapi_layout_test expect a Lustre pool named 'mypool'
to exist, with at least 2 OSTs. The -p option is used to change the
name.

    lctl pool_new lustre.mypool
    lctl pool_add lustre.mypool OST0000 OST0001

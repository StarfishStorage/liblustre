We've had to move a lot of Lustre parameters out of /proc/fs/lustre and into /sys/fs/lustre
for most parameter values, or /sys/kernel/debug/lustre (via debugfs) for large statistics
due to rules imposed by the upstream kernel developers.  This change has already been done
for the Lustre upstream client over a year ago.

If you use, for example, "lctl get_param version" to access this parameter and others then
the change is handled transparently.  If you are using direct access to /proc then you will
need to special-case this by version, or use a wildcard path like:

     /{proc,sys}/{fs,sys,kernel/debug}/{lustre,lnet}/
or
     {/sys/{fs,kernel/debug}/{lnet,lustre}/,/proc/{fs,sys}/{lnet,lustre}/}

Not all combinations of the above path are actually valid for all parameters, but this is a
catch-all combination that will find the various parameters.  The actual valid paths are
/proc/sys/lustre, /proc/fs/lustre, /sys/fs/lustre, /sys/kernel/debug/lustre, and similar for
lnet parameters.

Cheers, Andreas

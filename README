An LGPL lustre API

This is work in progress. NOT ALL FILES ARE UNDER LGPL YET.

See https://jira.hpdd.intel.com/browse/LU-5969 for the rationale.

Structure:

- A user application only has to include <lustre/lustre.h>. This
  header should only contains definitions that an application would
  need.

- lustre/lustre_user.h cannot be directly included by the user. It
  contains copies of kernel structures needed by the API. May be
  merged later within lustre.h

- lib/liblustre_internal.h contains various definitions and helpers
  that are needed for the library but need not be exported, such as
  private strutures, ioctls definitions, ...

This version adds the structure lustre_fs_h which represents a Lustre
filesystem. An application has to open the filesystem first with
lustre_open_fs, and an opaque handle is returned. This handle is then
used by functions like llapi_fid2path(), which have been modified to
require that handle. This avoids opening the filesystem for many
operations.

The posix copytool has been ported to thuis new API.


TODO:
- All exported API functions should be documented in lustre.h
- Fix all the "TODO"s


Changes:
- LPU64 is gone. Use "%llu". Cast if necessary.
- LPX64 is gone. Use "%#llx". Cast if necessary.
- LPX64i is gone. Use "%llx". Cast if necessary.
